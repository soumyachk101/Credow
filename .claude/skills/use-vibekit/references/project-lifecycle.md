# Project lifecycle

Use this guide for project creation, initialization, build scripts, LocalNet,
and setup troubleshooting.

## Choose a starter

`vibekit new` offers three additive TypeScript starters:

| Template      | Contents                                                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contracts`   | PuyaTs contracts, generated TypeScript clients, unit and LocalNet E2E tests |
| `fullstack`   | Contracts plus a React frontend and wallet integration                      |
| `kitchensink` | Contracts, frontend, event subscriber, and additional examples              |

Create a project with an explicit template:

```bash
vibekit new my-app --template contracts
cd my-app
npm install
```

For a fully headless run, also pass `--yes` and an explicit `--agents` list as
shown by `vibekit new --help`.

Without `--template`, let the user choose interactively. `vibekit new` fetches
the selected repository and then runs the same agent-setup flow as
`vibekit init`; skills, `AGENTS.md`, and MCP configuration are installed from
the CLI rather than baked into the starter repositories.

## Use the direct TypeScript toolchain

The starters do not require the AlgoKit CLI. Their npm scripts invoke the
underlying packages directly:

- `@algorandfoundation/puya-ts` compiles `*.algo.ts` contracts to TEAL and
  ARC-56 artifacts.
- `@algorandfoundation/algokit-client-generator` generates typed TypeScript
  clients from ARC-56 application specs.
- `algosdk` provides protocol-level clients, transactions, and signing types.
- `@algorandfoundation/algokit-utils` provides higher-level client,
  composition, testing, and application abstractions.

Treat `package.json` as the command source of truth. In the current starters,
the normal loop begins with:

```bash
vibekit localnet start
npm run build
npm test
```

Full-stack projects also provide `npm run dev`; the kitchen-sink starter adds
`npm run dev:subscriber`. Inspect scripts before using optional commands.

## Configure an existing project

```bash
vibekit init
```

This installs selected skills and agent/MCP configuration into the existing
directory. It merges supported configuration rather than replacing unrelated
MCP servers. Read the preview or prompt before allowing overwrites of existing
agent instruction files.

## Manage LocalNet

VibeKit owns the Docker-based local network lifecycle:

```bash
vibekit localnet start
vibekit localnet status
vibekit localnet fund ADDRESS --amount 10
vibekit localnet logs --tail 50
vibekit localnet reset
vibekit localnet stop
```

The default endpoints are Algod on `http://localhost:4001`, Indexer on
`http://localhost:8980`, and KMD on `http://localhost:4002`. Another LocalNet
using these ports cannot run concurrently.

`vibekit localnet reset` recreates the network. Treat it as destructive to
local chain state and confirm that resetting is intended. Add `--update` only
when the user also wants refreshed container images.

## Diagnose setup

```bash
vibekit doctor
vibekit doctor --fix
```

Run the read-only diagnosis first. Use `--fix` when the user asked for repair
or after explaining which supported configuration VibeKit will change.

Use `vibekit --version` to report the installed version. VibeKit currently has
no documented self-update command, so do not invent one.
